  This interface is designed to measure prediction accuracy for SaO2 desaturation events.
  You are shown real anonymized procedures. At the beginning of each procedure you are
  asked to provide a pre-operative risk, then at several random time points you are
  asked to provide a risk for the next five mintues.
  There are several things to keep in mind during use:</span>
  <ul style="opacity: 0.8;">
    <li style="margin: 7px;">You can cancel a prediction only during the record score panel. Otherwise future data will be shown and you cannot go backwards.</li>
    <li style="margin: 7px;">While by default the past hour of all recorded time data is shown, you can drag to see other time regions, or double-click
      to zoom in (shift-double-click to zoom out).</li>
    <li style="margin: 7px;">Performance is considered anonymous and will be reported publicly only in aggregate.</li>
  </ul>
